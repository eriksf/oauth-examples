# Sample OAuth2 Applications with Adama

Two example applications using OAuth2 to authenticate to [Araport](http://www.araport.org) and use an [Adama](https://github.com/Arabidopsis-Information-Portal/adama.git) service to query information about a gene.
The first example assumes you have created a client at Araport and generated a token. The token is entered into
the text box to run the query. The second example uses the OAuth2 "implicit flow" and leverages the [JSO](https://github.com/andreassolberg/jso)
JavaScript library.

## Prerequisites

For the JSO example, you will need to have an [Araport account](https://www.araport.org/user/register) and also register an OAuth2 client at Araport. To register a client:

```
$ curl -u "<araport-username>" -X POST --data "clientName=jso-test&description=jso-test&callbackUrl=http://localhost:9000" "https://api.araport.org/clients/v2"

{
    "message": "Client created successfully.",
    "result": {
        "_links": {
            "self": {
                "href": "http://araport-api.tacc.utexas.edu/clients/v2/jso-test"
            },
            "subscriber": {
                "href": "http://araport-api.tacc.utexas.edu/profiles/v2/eriksf"
            },
            "subscriptions": {
                "href": "http://araport-api.tacc.utexas.edu/clients/v2/jso-test/subscriptions/"
            }
        },
        "callbackUrl": "http://localhost:9000",
        "consumerKey": "****************************",
        "consumerSecret": "****************************",
        "description": "jso-test",
        "name": "jso-test",
        "tier": "Unlimited"
    },
    "status": "success",
    "version": "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-rc3fad"
}
```

Replace the client details in the initial JSO call in **jso/index.html** with the values received here.

For more detailed instructions see [Add OAuth Support to a Legacy App With Four Lines of JS](https://www.araport.org/node/1308).

You need to have the following installed:

- [Node.js + npm](http://nodejs.org/)
- grunt
  - `npm install -g grunt-cli`
  - `npm install -g bower`

After those are installed, clone this repo, cd into the directory, and run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eriksf/oauth-examples.git
$ cd oauth-examples/known-token (or jso)
$ npm install && bower install
$ grunt
```

## Development

You can interactively develop your app using the built-in test runner. Simply
execute this command from within the base directory of your app:

```bash
$ grunt
```

This will run your application on a local server at
[http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000). It will also watch your
app code for changes and automatically reload the browser when it detects
changes.
